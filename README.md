## Materials Needed

*   A WordPress site for practicing
*   A default theme such as [Twenty Sixteen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen) or [Twenty Seventeen theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyseventeen)
*   [Theme unit test data](https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/demo/theme-unit-test-data.xml) to import for example site
*   Link to [lipsum.com](http://lipsum.com/)
*   Include an image to upload for a featured image or find one from [http://placekitten.com/](http://placekitten.com/)
*   [Slides](https://wptrainingteam.github.io/) (included in this repo)

## Notes for the Presenter

*   You will be using the image uploader in this lesson, but not going into depth on a lot of the media features WordPress offers. A future lesson will go over this.
*   For this project you will copy and paste dummy content from [lipsum.com](http://lipsum.com/). This makes the process of creating test pages and posts faster. It's advised you explain to students the concept of "dummy content" in the development process.
*   The teacher should have access to the post editor and page editor, either installed locally or on a remote server. This editor should be visible to all students.
*   Optionally, students should have access to their Editors, either installed locally or on a remote server.
*   Instructions to the teacher are shown in square brackets.

## Have You Thought About...?

* Challenge 1

What could present challenges to delivering this lesson? Is there anything that can be done in advance to prepare for those challenges?

_For example:_

*  What if there’s no internet available?
*  What if there’s no projector available?
*  What if a participant doesn’t has a WordPress site to work with?
*  What if there aren’t enough computers for everyone?
*  What if no one has the prerequisite skills? What if there are different opinions about the topic?

## Lesson Overview

* First do this
* Then move on to this
* Finish with this

The plan for the lesson. Outline form works well.

_For example:_

* Talk about what a theme is

## Example Lesson

### Introduction

Today we are going to learn the differences between posts and pages. Although they look very similar, they each have unique functions. A post is dynamic, meaning it can be used and shown in many different ways (in a blog page, shared on social media, etc). A page is static, meaning that once you make it, the page stays in one spot until you physically change it. The best way to see the differences is to play around with both posts and pages.

### Log in to Your Site

Before you can create posts and pages, you need to log in to your site. Do this by entering the following in the web browser address bar: yourwebsite.com/wp-admin (Replace “yourwebsite.com” with the actual URL of your website.) Enter your username and password. You can check the “remember me” box if you will be using the same (non-public) computer to return to the website later and want to be logged in automatically. If this box is checked, your browser keeps you logged in for 14 days. If unchecked, you’ll be logged out when you close the browser or after two days. If you don’t remember your password, click the “Lost your password?” link below the form. Enter your username or email address and you will receive a link to create a new password via email.

### Practice Adding Posts

Now it's time to add a post. To add a post to your site, you can select "New" from the admin bar at the top. You can also go to Dashboard>Posts>Add New. Take a moment to explore the publishing options. You can publish immediately, schedule a post or even password-protect a post. If you only want part of your post showing on social media and on your main blog page, insert the the more tag as you edit your post. Your post will have a unique url. Notice how it says post-title in the following example? Ex: http://yourwebsite.wordpress.com/date/post-title/ (The actual path will depend on your settings under Settings>Permalinks.)

### Practice Adding Pages

When you are comfortable making a post, try creating a page. To add a page to your site, you can select "New" from the admin bar at the top. You can also go to Dashboard > Pages > Add New. Check out your publishing options on this page. Also note how the unique url is shown for pages by using page-title. For example: http://yourwebsite.wordpress.com/page-title/.

### Similarities Between Posts and Pages

Open your new post and your new page so they are side-by-side. Show how both have the following options:

*   Title
*   Content
*   Add Media
*   Add Contact Form
*   Discussion Options
*   Sharing Options
*   Featured Image
*   Privacy Settings

### Things Unique to Pages

Notice how pages are static and are not listed by date. They don't have tags or categories, and you can change the template. You can use a menu to make your pages stand out for readers, or you can use the pages widget. Some themes show pages in tabs at the top of a blog. Here are some popular uses for pages:

*   Category Page
*   Contact Page
*   About Page
*   Home Page

### Things Unique to Posts

As discussed earlier, posts are a bit different from pages. Check out how your posts can be found in archives, categories, recent posts, various widgets and RSS feeds of your blog. There are also different ways of showing posts. For example, you can create a sticky post, which means that the post will show before all other posts. You can also limit the number of posts shown by going to Dashboard>Reading>Settings.
